#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


#1.How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = "iPhone";

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales fs
ON c.order_id = fs.orderID;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity), SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(c.acctnum), AVG(quantity) * price
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales fs
ON c.order_id = fs.orderID
WHERE fs.quantity > 2;
